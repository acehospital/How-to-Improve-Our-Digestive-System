# How-to-Improve-Our-Digestive-System
The human digestive system consists of the gastrointestinal tract plus the accessory organs of digestion (the tongue, salivary glands, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder). Digestion involves the breakdown of food into smaller and smaller components, until they can be absorbed and assimilated into the body. The process of digestion has many stages. There are several organs and other components involved in the digestion of food. These organs are known as the accessory digestive glands (the liver, gall bladder and pancreas). Other components include the mouth, salivary glands, tongue, teeth and epiglottis. The largest part of the GI tract is the colon or large intestine.<br>


Indigestion — also called dyspepsia or an upset stomach — is a general term that describes discomfort in your upper abdomen. Indigestion is not a disease, but rather some symptoms you experience, including abdominal pain and a feeling of fullness soon after you start eating. Although indigestion is common, each person may experience indigestion in a slightly different way. A digestive disease is any health problem that occurs in the digestive tract. Conditions may range from mild to serious. Some common problems include cancer, irritable bowel syndrome, and lactose intolerance. 
Other digestive diseases include:
<ul>
<li>Gallstones, cholecystitis, and cholangitis</li>
<li>Rectal problems, such as anal fissure, hemorrhoids, proctitis, and rectal prolapsed</li>
<li>Esophagus problems, such as stricture (narrowing) and achalasia and esophagitis</li>
<li>Stomach problems, including gastritis, gastric ulcers usually caused by Helicobacter pylori infection and cancer</li>
<li>Liver problems, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C, cirrhosis, liver failure, and autoimmune and alcoholic hepatitis</li>
<li>Pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocyst</li>
<li>Intestinal problems, such as polyps and cancer, infections, celiac disease, Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, malabsorption, short bowel syndrome, and intestinal ischemia</li>
<li>Gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, and hiatal hernia.</li>

The best ways to prevent indigestion are:
<ol>
<li>Eating Organic Food</li>
<li>Getting Plenty of Fiber in Diet</li>
<li>Adding Healthy Fats to Your Diet</li>
<li>Staying Hydrated</li>
<li>Stress Management</li>
<li>Exercising Regularly.</li></ol><br>


Therefore living a disciplined life is the best way to get rid of digestion problems. If these steps are not followed in the right time, indigestion can take the form of colon problems and may require performing surgical procedures on the digestive tract. Tests to detect digestive problems like colonoscopy, upper GI endoscopy, capsule endoscopy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and endoscopic ultrasound are also very painful.<br>


While undergoing a colon therapy the easiest method to treat your colon is to get your colon cleansed in the natural way. Patients are given laxatives to eat under the recommendation of a doctor and undigested materials stacked up inside it are removed with bowel movements. Another way to cleanse  a colon  is undergoing a <a href="https://www.acehospitals.in/service/colon-therapy/">colon hydrotherapy</a> which helps in flushing out all indigested materials from one’s body and in turn it can helps patients who used to suffer from indigestion, get smoother and tighter skin, fresh smelling breath, bright vision and improved digestion by reducing pot belly, depression, and tendency of hair fall. <br>
